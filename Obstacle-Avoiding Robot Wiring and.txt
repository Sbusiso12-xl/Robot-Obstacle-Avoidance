Obstacle-Avoiding Robot Wiring and Setup Report
Project Title:
Smart Obstacle-Avoiding Robot with Path Scanning, Memory, and Fast Response

Objective:
To build and configure an Arduino-based robot that avoids obstacles with fast and smart scanning. The robot uses a servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor for environment awareness and remembers clear paths. It is powered by batteries for full mobility.

Hardware Components Required:
Component	Quantity
Arduino Uno	1
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)	1
Servo Motor (e.g. SG90)	1
L298N Motor Driver	1
DC Motors + Wheels	2
Robot Chassis	1
Power Supply (6xAA NiMH / 7.4V Li-ion)	1
Breadboard (optional)	1
Jumper Wires	Several
1000ÂµF Capacitor	1
Green and Red LEDs	1 each
220Î© Resistors (for LEDs)	2
SPDT Switch	1

Power Supply Notes:
Do NOT power motors or servo from the Arduino 5V pin.

Use a separate power source for motors and the servo.

Share the GND line between all components.

Step-by-Step Connection Guide:
ðŸ§  1. Arduino and Motor Driver (L298N)
Arduino Pin	L298N Pin
4 (MLa)	IN1
5 (MLb)	IN2
6 (MRa)	IN3
7 (MRb)	IN4
GND	GND
Vin	12V IN (if L298N needs logic power)

Motor Wires: Connect motor terminals to OUT1/OUT2 and OUT3/OUT4 of L298N.

Power: Connect battery pack (7.2Vâ€“9V) to L298N +12V and GND.

ðŸ“¡ 2. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
Arduino Pin	HC-SR04 Pin
9	TRIG
8	ECHO
5V (separate)	VCC
GND	GND

ðŸ¦¾ 3. Servo Motor (SG90)
Arduino Pin	Servo Pin
10	Signal
5V from Battery Buck Converter or Regulated 5V Supply	VCC
GND	GND

Add 1000ÂµF Capacitor between Servo VCC and GND to reduce brownouts.

ðŸ’¡ 4. LED Indicators
Arduino Pin	Component	Resistor	Color
2	Green LED	220Î©	Green
3	Red LED	220Î©	Red

Cathode (short leg) to GND.

ðŸ”˜ 5. SPDT Switch
Pin	Connection
12	Middle pin (signal)
One side	5V
Other side	GND

This acts as an ON/OFF toggle to enable or disable the robot logic.

Programming and Uploading
Open Arduino IDE.

Paste the final optimized code (provided in previous messages).

Connect Arduino via USB.

Select board and port.

Upload code.

Disconnect USB and connect battery.

Testing Checklist
Test	Expected Behavior
Ultrasonic detection	Robot moves forward if no obstacle within 18cm
Obstacle near (<10cm)	Robot stops and scans
Clear path found	Robot immediately goes that way
No path found	Robot reverses briefly
Switch turned OFF	Robot stops, LEDs OFF
Servo operation	Smooth movement, no jitter
LED indication	Green = Clear, Red = Obstacle

Final Notes:
Ensure GND is shared between all power sources and components.

For better performance, use a buck converter to regulate 5V to the servo.

To avoid motor interference, route servo wires separately if possible.
